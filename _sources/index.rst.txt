====================================================================================================================

Documentation for **ds_pycontain** python package to work with docker containers and images.

Example use case you might consider is to isolate python code execution generated by untrusted LLM by running it in a docker container.

This package makes it a bit easier to:

* Build docker images from Dockerfiles or in-memory string.
* Pull docker images from dockerhub (or similar).
* Run docker container to execute a one-off command.
* Run docker container to execute a long-running process and communicate with it.
